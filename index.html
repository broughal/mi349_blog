    <h2>Blog Postings</h2>

    <p>Below you will find my most recent blog postings. I write when I have down time, which doesn't seem to happen often enough. I don't usually think about the topic of the post until I sit down to write it, so whatever comes to mind ends up in the blog. To me, writing these postings allows my creativity to flow, and that's something that I find crucial to life. I don't ever want my creativity to be capped or hindered, as that would only damage the sould. Enjoy!.</p>
