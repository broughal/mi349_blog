    <h2>Blog Postings</h2>

    <p>Below you will find my most recent blog postings. I write when I have down time. I don't usually think about the topic of the post until I sit down to write it. Whatever comes to mind ends up in the blog. I like it to be a process that allows creativity to flow. Enjoy reading the thoughts circulating in my head.</p>
