            <p>Below you will find my most recent blog postings. I write when I have down time, which doesn't seem to happen often enough. I don't usually think about the topic of the post until I sit down to write it, so whatever comes to mind ends up in the blog. To me, writing these postings allows my creativity to flow, and that's something that I find crucial to life. I don't ever want my creativity to be capped or hindered as that would only damage the soul. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Welcome to my first blog entry. As I sit here at my computer trying to come up with a topic for this entry, my mind keeps wandering adrift and I find myself lost in thought regards to the music I’m listening to. It happens to be my favorite album ever, Luv Is Rage 2 (Deluxe) by Lil Uzi Vert. I think about how much time goes into each song he makes. I've heard some artists freestyle entire songs at a time and it's incredible that they can do that on the spot. Other artists have said that they’ve spent numerous years fine tweaking songs until they’re absolutely perfect. In one of Uzi’s songs he claims that he made a whole album in a month. Is this too little time put into an album? Or is he just so talented that he oozes hit after hit without even putting in the effort? Personally, as he’s my favorite artist and my opinion may be biased, I think he could make a hit in a day. Maybe not the beat too, but if the beat is pre existing, Uzi can spit out enough bars for his fans to listen to. Another crazy thing that I’ve recently learned is that sometimes producers will be bribed to drop leaks of songs before they’re released. So Uzi has numerous songs that he hasn’t officially put out himself, but it’s still him rapping over the beat. Some of his best songs and some of my favorites of his are leaks and not official song releases. This makes it harder to listen to since they aren’t on major streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.</p>

            <h3>Blog #2 - Skateboarding</h3>

            <p>With the increase in spare time that I had back in March when quarantine started, I decided to dive deeper into my hobbies. More specifically, my passion for skateboarding grew. I had purchased a board the previous summer but I broke my hand right away and couldn’t really skate that intensely for a while. I would skate to class and back, but it was slowly and cautiously. Over Christmas break I went down to Austin, Texas to spend the holidays with my cousins who live down there. We’ve got some old friends who used to live in Grand Rapids near us who moved to Austin so I hung out with them a few times. They skated too, so I went to the skatepark with them a few times. My hand was finally healed by then and I could finally start attempting tricks, but I was terrible. It wasn’t until February when I could finally ollie and then when quarantine hit I really got into the groove of it. Since then, my progress has been insane (in my opinion). I’ve learned so many new tricks that I would never have guessed I’d know at this point. I’m really glad my roommates also skate because it’s so much more fun in a group. Skating alone is nice sometimes but the energy and support from other people is what helps you progress faster.</p>
